Simple Clean
------------

The main purpose of the Simple Clean Theme is for it to be crazy simple to get a clean simple site up and running in no time. Just install and follow the step-by-step guide and your simple but still good looking clean website is running within the hour.

Simple Clean is a two column fixed design (optimized for width 960px). The content column have width 610px and right column (sidebar) have width 260px.


Quick step-by-step
------------------

Setting up a Drupal site involves many steps. This is some of the steps usually go through when I set up a Drupal site with Simple Clean Theme:

1. Install Drupal 6.x
2. Install Simple Clean Theme (Put simpleclean-folder in: sites/all/themes)
3. Enable and make Simple Clean default (admin/build/themes)
4. Edit theme settings (admin/build/themes/settings/simpleclean) - Add mission, slogan, etc.
5. Edit site information (admin/settings/site-information)
4. Activate search module (admin/build/modules)
5. Edit search settings (admin/settings/search)
6. Set permissions for search module (admin/permissions)
7. Enable Serch box in theme settings (admin/build/themes/settings/simpleclean)
8. Run cron to index search (admin/reports/status/run-cron)
9. Activate clean urls (admin/settings/clean-urls)
10. Add Home to Primary Links (admin/build/menu-customize/primary-links/add)
11. Edit settings for posts to have "submitted by" (admin/build/themes/settings)
12. If you want images in posts, edit user settings (admin/user/settings) Paste this url into default picture: sites/all/themes/simpleclean/images/no-pic.png (dont't forget to also active pictures in theme settings (admin/build/themes/settings/simpleclean)


Additional moduls
-----------------

You probably want to install serveral additional modules. If you want to use Block Menu instead of the built in subnavigation you can deactivate built in subnavigation in the theme settings (admin/build/themes/settings/simpleclean).
